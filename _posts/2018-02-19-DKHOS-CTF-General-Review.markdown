I got a text message on 10.01.2018 from one of the few people I enjoy working together on CTF.

Basically, he informed me about one of the biggest CTF events in Turkey and added 2 important things:
* This time we have a great team named KHORNE
* The goal is securing the first place and all members already agreed on donating prizes to [The Foundation for Children with Leukemia] in Turkey

Big day came and tasks were split. Everyone was so motivated and skillful in their field. Hours started to pass and we could see the scoreboard was changing already...

After solving the first tasks we started to slow down with the harder ones. There is a time of desperation on every CTF that you are actually about to finish the task but just cant go through the last step! Just after this, I heard someone yelling on the second night of the event :
```
Guys, do not forget why we are doing this. We are so close to make those children happy!
```
After 4 sleepless nights, 2 workdays in between, couple of disputes among members, we actually did it!

This is the brief story of my first triumph on securing the first place in a big CTF event.

From here, I'll talk about DKHOS CTF in details.

[DKHOS] is the sequel of DKH and DKHO (Dunyayi Kurtaran Hacker & Dunyayi Kurtaran Hackerin Oglu), held by [Invictus/Prodaft]. It's by far the biggest and most innovative CTF events in Turkey. (In here I should also mention the [Siberyildiz] failure). They actually put a flag on top of Bosphorus Bridge!

Scenarios were taken from real-life situations and put together such in a way that solver actually learns by solving it. There was even a [Twitch] 'hacking royale' in where 3 people choosen amongst the best in Web category and were given a machine with 7 flags.

Of course there were things I also didn't like and can consider these as great downsides.
* Group challenges were meaningless. Especially the last one with potential 700 points. There were groups who couldnt even get this much points. Yes, its innovative. Yes we did enjoy it. But Potential 700 points was too much. NERF THIS!
* In this hacking royale, people from [Invictus/Prodaft] were also providing information and possible alternatives. At a point, BURP Suite was mentioned and then all conversation went like 'Burp is like this, Burp is like that, everyone should use it and everything should be solved with it'. This is just like Javascript hype: 'If something can be done with Javascript, it DOES NOT MEAN you should do it with Javascript'. Yes we ARE aware that Burp makes things faster and it's really convenient but as an Application Security Engineer with Software development background, I would still prefer and recommend writing your scripts.
* Naming conventions were absolutely odd-awkward. If the solution is understanding 'whatsapp service' from task's name 'naber' (whats up!? in TR) then this is not a hacking question. Period.
* In some tasks, especially the one involving messaging apps, there were trolls.
* There were quite a number of cheating attempts we heard of. DKHOS team was successfull on monitoring and finding these but in the end even we were accused of minor cheating. We were expecting to at least getting some congratulations but in the end it was clear: 'Turkiye'de hic bir basari cezasiz kalmaz.'
* People are agressive-salty. I'm already aware that every group is putting their best efforts but being childish is a different thing...
* And the thing I disliked most is the actual problem in Turkey. Security, CybSec is just seen as red teaming. There were not even 1 hint of how these tasks should have been secured in the first place. As an Application Security Engineer with interest on blue teaming, next year I'm expecting an Attack and Defence style rather than Jeopardy.

All in all, we are the official winners now and learnt a lot in the way. I'll be publishing some writeups when I have more time.
